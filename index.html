    <p> Here is the cause and effect of plice brutality. This shows the brief proccess but more in depth, normally there will be a very minor situation including a police officer and a person that the police officer may be racist to. Then what normally happens is the police officer will become very hostile and agressive. Then after the police officer will aggresively handle the person resulting in the victims injury or most of the time death.

    <p>Here is the storyboard of the three scenes that was happening in the video animation. They show what is happening while at the store and a police officer assumes someone is stealing then taking them outside proceeding to beat them. After this, the next scene shows that person in the hospital from enduring the injuries from the offiver wrongly accusing them of stealing. </p>

  <p>For the character set we used a cardboard box as the stages and we used paper as the scenes backround. We used smaller cardboard boxes to show objects and small scene props.  </p>

    <p>Tech used in the project was a cricut printer, video recording app, and cannon camera. The printer wa used to create characters of the animation and small clothing etc. Then the recorder app was used to take pictures and combine all the captured pictures. The camera was also used to take the pictures so then the video recorder app could do its job. Below you will see a behind the scenes of the set and camera used to create the whole video.</p>

	<h1>Reasoning Pt.3</h1>  
     <p>The data wouldâ€™ve been different if the box didn't have a sort of tubing system because if it worked differently then they wouldn't have the same outcome thus proving an alternative claim makes the data different.
