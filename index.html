    <p> Here is the cause and effect of plice brutality. This shows the brief proccess but more in depth, normally there will be a very minor situation including a police officer and a person that the police officer may be racist to. Then what normally happens is the police officer will become very hostile and agressive. Then after the police officer will aggresively handle the person resulting in the victims injury or most of the time death.

    <p>Here is the storyboard of the three scenes that was happening in the video animation. They show what is happening while at the store and a police officer assumes someone is stealing then taking them outside proceeding to beat them. After this, the next scene shows that person in the hospital from enduring the injuries from the offiver wrongly accusing them of stealing. </p>

  <p>For the character set we used a cardboard box as the stages and we used paper as the scenes backround. We used smaller cardboard boxes to show objects and small scene props.  </p>

    <p>My evidence supports my claim because as I explained in the evidence when water is poured in none may come out and sometimes more or less comes out. This supports my claim because my claim was “I think the black box has some sort of tubing system managing the intake water and determining the output of that water.” Therefore giving me a reasonable idea to have the claim that I do. 
    </p>
     <h1>Reasoning Pt.3</h1>  
     <p>The data would’ve been different if the box didn't have a sort of tubing system because if it worked differently then they wouldn't have the same outcome thus proving an alternative claim makes the data different.
